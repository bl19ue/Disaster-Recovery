# Disaster-Recovery
•	Implemented a system that was able to detect failures and problems occurring in a cloud infrastructure (Virtual Machines and Virtual Hosts) and take actions accordingly to prevent the failure.

•	Detections were done through heartbeat mechanism and alarm trigger on the vCenter Server.

•	This was an independent module which worked along with the Private Cloud Infrastructure and provided a great level of disaster recovery.
